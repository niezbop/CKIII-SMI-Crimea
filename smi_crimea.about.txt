[h1]About[/h1]

[b]Slightly More Interesting Crimea[/b] is a mod that makes it more interesting to play in and around the crimean peninsula by adding a new culture: the [b]Crimean Goths[/b]. They're one of the last remnants of the eastern germanic people.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] A new culture, the [b]Gothic[/b] culture, present in the county of Kerch
[*] Comes with Central Germanic heritage and language
[*] Comes with a custom name list
[*] Impacts both 867 and 1066 start dates
[/list]

[h1]Historical accuracy[/h1]

While the existence of the Crimean Goths is pretty well documented, the limitation of the CK3 engine can't exactly translate the reality (or at least what we know of it). For that reason, the culture in the whole county of Kerch has been set to the new culture, while most probably Kerch wasn't totally gothic. The historical strategos of the area in 867, [b]Petronas Kamateros[/b] hasn't been changed from CK3 to keep historical accuracy, which means that there are no playable Gothic ruler in any of the start dates.

In the end, I believe that this mod is a bit more accurate than vanilla CK3, but still not totally accurate.

[h2]Known incompatibilies[/h2]
[list]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2432829205]Talamu-Anu: Full Culture Expansion[/url] also adds Crimean Gothic to the area. I prefer my implementation to theirs, and mine only touches Crimea, chose one or the other.
[*] Total conversion mods are logically not compatible
[*] Any file that changes [i]history/provinces/k_pontic_steppe.txt[/i] will be incompatible. I play with a rather large mod list and have found no other mods than the one listed above that change this file.
